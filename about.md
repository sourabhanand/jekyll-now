I am currently working as a Software Engineer for [Xilinx Inc.](https://www.xilinx.com/), focussing on developing software tools for FPGA Device Model Verification and am based out of Hyderabad, India.
Prior to this, I worked as Software Engineer at [MulticoreWare Inc](https://multicorewareinc.com/). for almost 3 years where I developed avid interest in Machine Learning specifically in the field of Convolutional Neural Networks. I worked on developing optimized CNN algorithms for embbeded DSPs.

I received my Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [VIT University](http://www.vit.ac.in/), Vellore.

In this blog I will be mostly posting Machine Learning stuff as and when I learn or implement something new. I strongly believe in Andrew Ng's theory that *AI is the new electricity* and I also believe that open source community has a great role to play to make it a reality. This blog is my mite contribution for the cause.
